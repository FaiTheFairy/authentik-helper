# Invites

Use the Invites panel to bring new people into your Authentik setup.

## Create an invite

1. Fill out:
   - Name — full name
   - Username — login name in Authentik
   - Email — where the invite will be sent
   - Expiry days — how long the invite is valid
   - Single use — if the link should work only once
2. Click Create Invitation.

## What gets sent

- Email includes your brand name, logo, and a button to continue.
- A plain link is included as a fallback.
- The link stops working once the invite expires or has been used.
